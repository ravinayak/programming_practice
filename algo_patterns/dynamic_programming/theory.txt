Dynamic Programming involves the following 3 requirements:
  1. Optimal Substructure: 
				Given problem must be such that it can be broken down into smaller subproblems such
				that solution of smaller subproblems when combined together can solve given problem
		2. Overlapping subproblems:
				Nature of subproblems must be such that they are overlapping in nature meaning that
				we can reuse solution to a subproblem when it repeats itself. This allows us to
				solve the problem in less time using less space, since a number of subproblems which
				repeat themselves are already solved
		3. Recursion:
				This is simply for the sake of mentioning. Any problem which has the above 2 attributes
				of (1) and (2) can be solved through naive recursion technique

Dynamic programming problems can be solved through following 2 approaches:
		1. Recursion:
					Top Down Approach - Memoization
		2. Iterative:
					Bottom Up Approach - Tabulation
