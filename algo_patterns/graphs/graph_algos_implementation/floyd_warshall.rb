# Handling Negative Edge Weights:

# Negative Cycle Detection: If graph has a cycle where the sum
# of all edge weights in the cycle is negative, it cannot be
# handled by Floyd-Warshall algorithm. However, it can be detected
# by the algorithm. In case of negative Weight Cycle, this algorithm
# cannot compute distance of nodes correctly.
# Floyd-Warshall can handle negative edge weights, but if thereâ€™s a
# negative weight cycle (a cycle where the sum of the edge weights is
# negative), the algorithm cannot properly compute the shortest paths.
# To detect negative cycles, after running the algorithm, you check if
# any dist[i][i] < 0 for any vertex i. If this happens, it indicates
# that there is a negative cycle in the graph.

# Floyd Warshall Algorithm expects the adjacency matrix to be a 2D
# matrix where each pair of vertices (i, j) has some weight assigned
# it if there is an edge between (i, j)
# adj_matrix[i][j] = weight (if there is an edge between "i" and "j")
# adj_matrix[i][j] = nil (if there is no edge between "i" and "j")

  # NOTE: But there is a HUGE PROBLEM WITH THIS APPROACH. It creates a
  # SHALLOW COPY
  # This approach initializes a 2D array by creating one inner array
  # (Array.new(n)) and then assigning the same inner array reference to
  # each row of the outer array.
  # If any element of the outer array changes elements in the sub array
  # sub-arrays of all elements will be changed leading to UnIntended
  # Behavior
  #
  # DO NOT USE THIS => distance = Array.new(n, Array.new(n))

  # Below CREATES => Unique Inner Arrays
  # This approach initializes the 2D array using a block. The block is
  # evaluated separately for each row, ensuring that each row gets a new,
  # independent inner array.
