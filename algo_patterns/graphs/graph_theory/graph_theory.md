Graph traversal strategies are essential for exploring and processing
the nodes and edges of a graph. The most common graph traversal methods are:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

   • Strategy: Explores all the nodes at the present depth level before moving
   on to the nodes at the next depth level.
   • Implementation: Typically uses a queue (FIFO) to keep track of the nodes
   to visit next.
   • Use cases:
   • Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
   • Checking connectivity of components.
   • Level-order traversal in trees.
   • Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is
   the number of edges.

2. Depth-First Search (DFS)

   • Strategy: Explores as far along each branch as possible before backtracking,
   essentially diving deep into one path before exploring another.
   • Implementation: Uses a stack (LIFO) or recursion to track nodes.
   • Use cases:
   • Detecting cycles in a graph.
   • Finding connected components.
   • Topological sorting of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
   • Time complexity: O(V + E).

3. Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU)

   • Strategy: Maintains disjoint sets (groups of connected nodes) and efficiently
   merges and finds components.
   • Operations:
   • Union: Connects two sets by joining their roots.
   • Find: Determines which set a particular element is in.
   • Use cases:
   • Detecting cycles in an undirected graph.
   • Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
   • Checking connectivity in a dynamic graph.
   • Time complexity: Nearly constant time O(α(V)), where α is the inverse Ackermann
   function, which grows very slowly.

4. Topological Sort

   • Strategy: Provides a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed
   Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u → v), vertex u comes
   before vertex v in the ordering.
   • Implementation: Often done using DFS or Kahn’s algorithm.
   • Use cases:
   • Scheduling tasks based on dependency ordering.
   • Finding a valid order in dependency graphs.
   • Time complexity: O(V + E).

5. Dijkstra’s Algorithm

   • Strategy: BFS-like algorithm with a priority queue to find the shortest
   path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
   • Implementation: Uses a min-priority queue to keep track of the minimum
   distance.
   • Use cases:
   • Finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.
   • Time complexity: O((V + E) log V).

6. A Search Algorithm

   • Strategy: Extension of Dijkstra’s algorithm that includes a heuristic
   function to guide the search more quickly to the goal.
   • Implementation: Uses a priority queue with a combination of the actual
   distance from the source and the heuristic estimate to the goal.
   • Use cases:
   • Pathfinding algorithms in AI (e.g., game development, robot navigation).
   • Time complexity: Depends on the heuristic used, but similar to Dijkstra’s for
   admissible heuristics.

7. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

   • Strategy: Dynamic programming algorithm to find the shortest paths between all
   pairs of vertices in a graph.
   • Implementation: Uses a 2D matrix to store shortest paths and iteratively updates
   it.
   • Use cases:
   • Finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in dense graphs.
   • Time complexity: O(V^3).

8. Bellman-Ford Algorithm

   • Strategy: Like Dijkstra’s, but can handle graphs with negative weight edges.
   • Implementation: Relaxes all edges V-1 times.
   • Use cases:
   • Finding the shortest path in graphs that contain negative weight edges.
   • Detecting negative weight cycles.
   • Time complexity: O(VE).

9. Kruskal’s Algorithm

   • Strategy: A greedy algorithm that sorts all edges and adds the smallest edge to
   the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) if it doesn’t form a cycle.
   • Implementation: Uses Union-Find to check if adding an edge will form a cycle.
   • Use cases:
   • Finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
   • Time complexity: O(E log E).

10. Prim’s Algorithm

    • Strategy: Similar to Kruskal’s, but starts with a single vertex and adds the smallest
    edge that connects to an unvisited vertex.
    • Implementation: Often uses a priority queue to select the next smallest edge.
    • Use cases:
    • Finding MST in a dense graph.
    • Time complexity: O(V^2) for simple implementation, O(E log V) with a priority queue.

11. Tarjan’s Algorithm

    • Strategy: DFS-based algorithm used to find strongly connected components (SCCs) in a
    directed graph.
    • Implementation: Uses a stack and low-link values to identify SCCs.
    • Use cases:
    • Finding SCCs.
    • Finding articulation points or bridges in undirected graphs.
    • Time complexity: O(V + E).

Each strategy has specific applications and is suited for different types of problems,
whether it’s finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, or building spanning trees.
