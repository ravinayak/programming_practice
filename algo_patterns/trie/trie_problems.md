Trie-based interview questions are popular in software engineering interviews, especially for roles that require strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Here are some common interview questions related to tries, along with brief explanations:

1. Implement a Trie
   Question: Implement a Trie with insert, search, and starts_with (prefix search) operations.
   Explanation: This is a fundamental question to test your understanding of how a Trie is structured and how to manipulate it to support basic operations.
2. Word Search II
   Question: Given a 2D board and a list of words, find all words on the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.
   Explanation: This problem often uses a Trie to efficiently search for multiple words in the board by building a Trie from the list of words and using DFS (Depth-First Search) to explore the board.
3. Autocomplete System
   Question: Design an autocomplete system where given a prefix, you need to return the top-k most frequently used words that start with the prefix.
   Explanation: You can use a Trie to store the words along with their frequency. The challenge lies in efficiently retrieving the top-k words that match the prefix.
4. Longest Word in Dictionary
   Question: Given an array of strings, return the longest word in the dictionary that can be formed by successively adding letters to a string. If there is more than one possible result, return the word that is lexicographically smallest.
   Explanation: A Trie can be used to efficiently check if the prefixes of a word exist in the dictionary as you search for the longest valid word.
5. Add and Search Word - Data Structure Design
   Question: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and searching for a word with the ability to use the dot (.) as a wildcard character, which can represent any letter.
   Explanation: The Trie needs to be adapted to handle wildcard characters during the search, which requires a DFS-like traversal to explore all possible matches.
6. Replace Words
   Question: In a dictionary of words, replace the words in a sentence with the shortest prefix in the dictionary.
   Explanation: You can use a Trie to store all dictionary words and efficiently search for the shortest prefix to replace the words in the sentence.
7. Search Suggestions System
   Question: Given a list of products and a search word, design a system that suggests at most three product names from the list after each character of the search word is typed. Products should be returned in lexicographical order.
   Explanation: Build a Trie from the list of products and use it to efficiently find and return the top 3 suggestions after each character is typed.
8. Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array
   Question: Given a non-empty array of integers, find the maximum XOR of two numbers in the array.
   Explanation: This problem can be solved using a Trie to efficiently compare binary representations of the numbers to find the maximum XOR.
9. Concatenated Words
   Question: Given a list of words, find all the concatenated words in the list. A concatenated word is a word that is composed entirely of at least two shorter words in the list.
   Explanation: A Trie can be used to check if a word can be broken down into smaller words by searching for prefixes.
10. Palindrome Pairs
    Question: Given a list of unique words, find all the pairs of distinct indices (i, j) such that the concatenation of the two words words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.
    Explanation: This problem can be solved using a Trie by searching for possible palindromic pairs efficiently.
    Tips for Answering Trie-Related Interview Questions:
    Understand the Basic Operations: Make sure you're comfortable with implementing insert, search, and starts_with in a Trie.
    Practice Recursive and Iterative Approaches: Some Trie problems may require recursive traversal (e.g., searching with wildcards) or iterative methods (e.g., constructing the Trie).
    Think About Optimization: Consider space optimization techniques, like using a compressed Trie (also known as a radix tree), if applicable.
    Edge Cases: Be aware of common edge cases, such as empty strings, very long words, or non-alphabetic characters, and be ready to handle them.
