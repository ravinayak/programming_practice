1. Flood Fill Algorithm - Directions Array - Adjacent 4 sides connected Problem
   1. Always check for both conditions of new_row and new_col
      - new_row >=0 && new_row < row_length
      - new_col >=0 && new_col < col_length
      - Any index in a 2D array must be in Range - ( >=0 && < Max Length of Row/Col)
