# To implement a queue using two stacks in Ruby efficiently, we will use two stacks 
# to manage the queue operations. This approach ensures that each element is moved 
# only once between the stacks, making the operations efficient.

# Approach:
# 1. Two Stacks: Use two stacks, stack_in and stack_out.
#     a. stack_in is used for enqueue operations.
#     b. stack_out is used for dequeue operations.
# 2. Enqueue Operation (push):
#     a. Simply push the new element onto stack_in.
# 3. Dequeue Operation (pop):
#     a. If stack_out is empty, pop all elements from stack_in and push them onto stack_out. 
#     b. This reverses the order, making the first element to be enqueued the first to be 
#        dequeued.
#     c. Then, pop the top element from stack_out.

# Understanding Amortized Time Complexity for the Dequeue Operation in a Queue Implemented with 
# Two Stacks To explain why the dequeue operation in a queue implemented using two stacks has
# an amortized time complexity of O(1), we need to understand how the stacks are used and what 
# "amortized" means in this context.

# How the Two-Stack Queue Works
# 1. Two Stacks (stack_in and stack_out):
#     a. stack_in is used to push (enqueue) new elements.
#     b. stack_out is used to pop (dequeue) elements.
# 2. Enqueue (enqueue) Operation:
#     a. Every element is simply pushed onto stack_in. This operation always takes O(1) time
# 3. Dequeue (dequeue) Operation:
#     a. If stack_out is not empty, pop an element from stack_out and return it. This operation
#         is O(1)
#      b. If stack_out is empty, all elements from stack_in are transferred to stack_out
#        (one by one),and then an element is popped from stack_out.
#      c. The transfer operation can take up to O(n) time if there are n elements in stack_in

# Amortized Analysis: Why Dequeue is O(1) on Avergae:
# Amortized time complexity considers the average time per operation over a sequence of operations, 
# rather than the worst-case time of a single operation. Hereâ€™s why the amortized time complexity
# of the dequeue operation is O(1)
# 1. Single Transfer Per Element:
#     a. An element is moved from stack_in to stack_out at most once throughout its lifetime in 
#        the queue.
#     b. Once transferred to stack_out, an element will not be moved back to stack_in. It stays 
#        in stack_out until it is dequeued
# 2. Cost Breakdown:
#     a. When an element is enqueued, it is pushed to stack_in, costing O(1)
#     b. When a dequeue operation requires a transfer from stack_in to stack_out, the cost of
#        transferring n elements is O(n)
#     c. After the transfer, each of these n elements can be dequeued in O(1) time because they
#        are now in stack_out
# 3. Amortized Calculation:
#     a. Consider n enqueue operations followed by n dequeue operations
#     b. Each element is enqueued in O(1) time
#     c. The first dequeue operation after the transfer is O(n) because of the transfer, but 
#        all subsequent dequeues are O(1) since elements are already in stack_out
#     d. The total cost for dequeuing n elements is 
#          => O(n)+O(1)+O(1)+...+O(1) = O(n) (after the transfer)
#     e. The total cost for n enqueue operations and n dequeue operations is O(n) + O(n) = O(2n)
#     f. The average (amortized) time per operation is = O(2n)/n = O(1)

# Summary:
# 1. Worst-case time complexity for a single dequeue operation can be O(n) when a transfer is needed.
# 2. Amortized time complexity for dequeue over a sequence of operations is O(1) because each 
#    element is transferred at most once and then only popped once.
# 3. This O(1) amortized time is achieved because the cost of transferring elements from stack_in to 
#    stack_out is spread out over all the dequeue operations, effectively making each operation constant 
#     time on average.
