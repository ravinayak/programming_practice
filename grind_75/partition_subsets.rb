# frozen_string_literal: true

# Given an integer array nums, return true if you can partition the array into
# two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal or
# false otherwise.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

# NOTE: Classical problem in CS
# This is a classic problem in computer science where we have to find if for a
# given set of elements, there exists a subset of elements which can add upto
# a given target.
# When we are given a problem to partition an array into two subsets such that
# the sum of the elements in both subsets is equal, basically we are being
# asked the same question in another form. An array can be divided into "k"
# sets such that the sum of each set is equal ONLY when the sum of elements in
# the array is exactly divisible by "k". In this case, we have to find in iteration
# a set of elements (which have not been used in previously generated sets) such
# that sum of elements in the set is = total_sum / k. This is the same problem now
# as the classic problem, find a subset of elements from the set that add upto
# given target

# @param [Array<Integer>] input_arr
# @param [Integer] k
# @return [Array]

    # Each time we call this function, it returns a set of elements from
    # the input_array which have not been used to create a set before
    # and which sum upto the given target.
    # Every set forms a subset and is collected in sets array to give us
    # all the "k" subsets of input_arr which have equal sum
