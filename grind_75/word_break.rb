# frozen_string_literal: true

# Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if
# s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more
# dictionary words.

# Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times
# in the segmentation.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
# Output: false

# Algorithm: In order to find if a word can be broken into space separated words, each
# of which are contained in a word Dictionary, we use DP strategy

# Step 1:  Initialize a DP array dp of size len(s) + 1 where all values are False, except dp[0],
# which is True. This is because an empty string can always be segmented.

# Step 2:  For each position i in the string s, check all possible substrings s[j:i] where
# 0 â‰¤ j < i. If dp[j] is True and s[j:i] is in wordDict, set dp[i] to True.
#  => dp[i] = true if the substring s[0:i] can be segmented into words in wordDict, and
#     False otherwise
#  => dp[i]
#    = substring formed by including characters "0" through "i-1" of string
#    = s[0:i] => s[0...i] => s[0] + s[1] + s[2] + .... + s[i-1]
#    = s[0] is included, s[i] is excluded
#    = All characters of string before "i" are included

# Step 3:  After processing the entire string, return dp[len(s)], which tells us whether the
# entire string s can be segmented.

# Step 4: dp[str.length] = true => word can be split into words which are in wordDict

def word_break(word:, word_dict:)

  # Base Case of DP

  #       = if we start from "0", we will include 0 characters of string = empty substring

  #       = 0...s.length = (0..s.length - 1) = s.length characters of string = Entire string
  # 1..word_length and NOT 1...word_length
  (1..word.length).each do |i|
    # dp[i] = dp[j] + substr[j, i-1] => we start from "0" because we want to include
    # all use cases for string where 0 <= j < i
    #    => for i = 4, for ex: (substring formed by including 1st 4 characters of string can be segmented)
    #    => j = 0 => dp[0] = substr formed by 1st 0 characters of string: substr[], substr[0..3] in wordDict
    #    => j = 1 => dp[1] = substr formed by 1st 1 characters of string: substr[0..0], substr[1..3] in wordDict
    #    => j = 2 => dp[2] = substr formed by 1st 2 characters of string: substr[0..1], substr[2..3] in wordDict
    #    => j = 3 => dp[3] = substr formed by 1st 3 characters of string: substr[0..2], substr[3..3] in wordDict
    # More Explanation: Consider string = 'catsand' and i = 4 => substring formed by including 1st 3 characters of string
    #    => j = 0 => dp[0], substr[0..3] => [], [cats]
    #    => j = 1 => dp[1], substr[1..3] => [c], [ats]
    #    => j = 2 => dp[2], substr[2..3] => [ca], [ts]
    #    => j = 3 => dp[3], substr[3..3] => [cat], [s]
    #    => "", "cats"; "c", "ats"; "ca", "ts"; "cat", "s" are all possible segments for "cats"
    # If we allow j to go till "i", we will have 'cats', "" which is a duplicate of 1st use case
    # and also cause 2 major issues:
    #  Issue 1: Out of bounds: substr[4, 3] => This could be invalid in many programming languages
    #  Issue 2: We would end up checking if an empty string is in wordDict => which could give us faulty results
    #
    # WE start from 0, so all "i-1" combinations of susbstring can be tested in wordDict
