1. Real-time Gameplay

   • Use WebSockets for real-time communication between players. This ensures that moves are synchronized instantly between both clients.
   • ActionCable (Rails WebSocket) is a good solution for real-time features if you’re using Ruby on Rails.
   • Alternatively, a backend service with Redis can be used to handle game state management and broadcast real-time updates to clients.

2. Persistent Game State

   • Database Persistence: Store the game state in a database, e.g., PostgreSQL. Each move can be recorded, allowing players to save and load games.
   • Versioning: Store each move as a record in the database, so players can rewind and replay the game from any move.
   • Game History: Save move history for each game to allow players to revisit completed games or analyze past strategies.

3. Handling Multiple Games

   • Support multiple ongoing games at the same time by creating a table for games in the database, with each row representing a game.
   • Use unique game IDs to distinguish between different games.
   • Game Rooms: Allow players to create or join game rooms with unique identifiers. Use a message-passing system (like WebSockets or Redis)
   to keep track of which room each player is in.

4. Scalability Considerations

   • Horizontal Scaling: Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers as the number of games or players increases.
   • Caching: Use caching systems like Memcached or Redis to store frequently accessed game states and avoid repeated database queries.
   • Asynchronous Processing: If your game has additional features like AI opponents, asynchronous job queues like Sidekiq can be used to
   offload heavy tasks like AI move calculations to background workers.

5. Security

   • Authentication: Players should have unique accounts. Use OAuth or session management to ensure users are authenticated and authorized
   to access their games.
   • Move Validation: All moves should be validated server-side to prevent cheating. Ensure that players can only make legal moves based on
   the current game state.

6. AI Opponents

   • You could offer games against AI opponents by implementing AI move logic using well-known chess algorithms such as Minimax with
   alpha-beta pruning.
   • To keep this scalable, compute-intensive AI tasks should be processed asynchronously, and multiple games can be run concurrently on
   separate workers.

7. Mobile and Web Support

   • Make the game responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile browsers.
   • Alternatively, create a dedicated mobile app using a cross-platform framework like React Native for real-time mobile gameplay.

8. Leaderboards and Achievements

   • Track player performance (e.g., number of wins, properties owned) and implement leaderboards.
   • Add achievements to incentivize continued play, such as “First Monopoly Win” or “Longest Game Played”.

This approach will enable you to build a scalable chess web application that supports multiplayer games, persistence, and smooth, real-time
interactions.
