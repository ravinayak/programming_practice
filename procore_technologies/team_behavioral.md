1. Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker

Situation: In one of my previous roles, I worked on a team where we had to implement a new feature that was critical for an upcoming release. The team had a disagreement about the best approach to take. One of my coworkers advocated for using a specific framework that I felt was not the best fit for our current system architecture, as it could introduce significant overhead and long-term maintenance issues.

Task: As the team lead, my responsibility was to make sure that we were delivering the best possible solution while maintaining harmony and avoiding unnecessary friction within the team.

Action: I scheduled a meeting to discuss the different approaches, making sure to hear everyone’s opinion, including the coworker with whom I had a disagreement. I presented my concerns about the long-term technical debt that could result from the framework he was proposing. At the same time, I encouraged him to explain why he thought his approach was viable and allowed the team to voice their thoughts.

To resolve the conflict, I suggested creating a small proof of concept (POC) for each of our proposed solutions. This way, we could test the impact of both approaches in a controlled environment. After the POC, we compared the performance, ease of integration, and long-term maintainability.

Result: The POC showed that my concerns about the overhead were valid, and the team decided to go with my approach. However, the experience also helped the coworker and I understand each other’s perspectives better, and it fostered a healthier collaboration between us going forward. The final solution worked well, and we delivered the feature on time without compromising system performance.

2. Tell me about a time when you fixed a problem at work before anyone else found out

Situation: During one of my projects, I was working on a backend system where we were handling user authentication and authorization. While reviewing the logs for another issue, I noticed a pattern of failed login attempts, indicating that our rate-limiting feature (meant to prevent brute-force attacks) was not functioning as expected. This vulnerability was critical because it could potentially allow malicious users to guess passwords by brute force.

Task: As soon as I realized the potential risk, I knew that I needed to fix it before anyone exploited the issue or before it was detected by others in a security audit. My responsibility was to patch the system without disrupting ongoing services.

Action: I quickly investigated the root cause of the issue, which turned out to be an edge case where the rate-limiting mechanism failed to reset for certain users under specific conditions. I wrote a patch that correctly handled the edge case and deployed it immediately in a controlled manner. At the same time, I monitored the system to ensure no other issues were triggered by the fix.

I also documented the bug and notified the team about the issue after it was resolved. I proposed additional unit tests to catch similar problems in the future and improve our monitoring system to detect such patterns earlier.

Result: The issue was resolved before any damage occurred or before the team or users noticed it. The patch worked perfectly, and our rate-limiting feature was now fully operational. This proactive fix improved the system’s security, and we added better monitoring mechanisms to detect such anomalies earlier in the future.
